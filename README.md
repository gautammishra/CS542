<h3>Link State Routing Simulation using Dijkstra's Algorithm</h3>
<b>This project was a part of CS542 Computer Networks - I course.</b>
<b>The main goals of the implementation of Link State Routing Protocol are as follows:</b>
<ul>
<li>etting all the shortest path(s) from a given source node to destination node with the given network topology (as specified in adjacency matrix).</li>
<li>enerating routing table (connection table) for each node (router) in the network.</li>
<li>sing Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to obtain the shortest path as well as the direction between two nodes.</li>
<li>imulating the points mentioned above using Graphical User Interface.</li>
<li>unctionality to modify an edge i.e. modifying link weight of a existing edge between two nodes and also to add a new link/edge between two nodes. In both the cases, the shortest path(s) has to be updated.</li>
<li>unctionality to add a node to the existing topology and consequently find a new connection table, and shortest path(s) from a source node to a destination node.</li>
<li>isplay all the possible paths between two directly connected nodes.</li>
</ul>
